This article is a walkthrough through the process of publishing a new plugin to Katalon Store. If you just want to get started, head to the Submit a new plugin page on the Store.

To start, familiarize yourself with the Developer Agreement and Guidelines to develop a new plugin.

Next, prepare your plugin for publication by adding all its files to a ZIP archive with the extension .zip.
